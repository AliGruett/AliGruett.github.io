									<h3>Ali Gruett, CPA</h3>
									<p>I am actively seeking a role as a financial analyst, data analyst, or business intelligence analyst, where I can leverage my skills and experience to drive data-driven insights and contribute to organizational success.</p>
								</header>
								<p>I am a results-oriented CPA licensed Audit Manager with over 5 years of experience specializing in internal audits and monitoring activities for diverse federally funded programs. A graduate from the State University of New York at New Paltz, I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in accounting and an MBA focused in public accountancy.</p>
								<p>In my pursuit of expanding my skill set, I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate program. This certification has equipped me with practical experience in collecting, transforming, and organizing data for in-depth analysis. By leveraging these newfound skills, I am adept at generating actionable insights that drive informed decision-making processes.</p>
								<p>As an audit manager, I have successfully managed internal audits and reviews, developed audit plans and strategies, and performed data analysis using Power Query to identify anomalies and trends. I have also maintained accurate and organized audit documentation, prepared reports, and facilitated communication between external auditors and the agency. One of my notable accomplishments is developing a Power BI dashboard to upgrade the audit tracking function for not-for-profit organizations that have contracts with the agency.<p>
								<p>Proficiency in Microsoft Excel and Power BI serves as a strong foundation for my data analysis and visualization capabilities. I leverage these tools to extract valuable insights, identify trends, and present complex data in a clear and concise manner. Currently, I am further developing my expertise in SQL and R to deepen my data manipulation and analytics capabilities.</p>
								<p>Outside of work, I enjoy taking art classes, especially anything to do with ceramics or pottery. I love taking a long weekend to explore a new city or town. Fitness and health play integral roles in my life and you'll often find me at the gym a few times a week. </p>
								<p>Thank you for visiting my online portfolio, and I welcome the opportunity to connect with potential employers to explore how my skills and experience can contribute to your organization's success.</p>
